         <li>High Risk: Applications in critical infrastructure, education, or employment</li>
         <li>Limited Risk: Systems requiring transparency, like chatbots</li>
         <li>Minimal Risk: Most basic AI applications</li>
       </ul>`,
      `<h2>Impact on Businesses</h2>
       <p>Organizations must prepare for these regulations by:</p>
       <ul>
         <li>Conducting risk assessments</li>
         <li>Implementing robust documentation practices</li>
         <li>Ensuring transparency in AI decision-making</li>
         <li>Establishing oversight mechanisms</li>
       </ul>`,
      `<h2>Preparing for Compliance</h2>
